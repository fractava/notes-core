# FRACTAVA Notes Core

__Currently Work in Progress__

The Core Libary of our Notes Apps.
It contains the Editor, but cannot run by itself.

## Dev Server
The Dev Server is used to get a development server that watches the libary files and lets you test the libary without pushing in to npm.
Its not a part of the package fractava/fractava-notes-core on npm.

To start the dev server run:
- npm link 
- cd dev-server
- npm install
- npm link @fractava/fractava-notes-core
- npm run serve 

Now the Server runs on Port 8080
